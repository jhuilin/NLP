17th June 2000
Dear Sir or Madam ,
On 14th June 2000 I went to see your " Over The Rainbow " musical show and I have a few points which I would like to bring to your attention .
Your advertisement was featuring " Danny Brook and Tina Truelove " as the main characters but in fact some other people replaced them that evening .
The time mentioned on the tickets was 19:30 however the show started at 20:15 .
As I came to London on holidays and purchased " The London City Guide " I saw your advertisement explaining that people could buy discounted tickets for £ 5 in advance .
Well I tried to do so but the lady at the desk told me that they were quotas available at that price but were already sold out !
After the show we tried to go to your restaurant but unfortunately it was closed for renovation !
I was very disappointed of my supposed " perfect evening out " to your theatre and due to all the above-mentioned reasons I am asking for a complete refund on the two attached tickets .
Yours faithfully ,
Modern technology
" Technology " is an appealing as well as an interesting word for me .
From ancient times up to now this science has allowed the world and human-beings to develop positively and negatively .
Egyptians , Mayas , Incas , etc. were civilisations with great knowledge because they were mastering most of the science fields we deal with today .
Back in the 30's the different governments invented guns , battleships and all kinds of weapons for their armies .
The military technology has affected our lives more than what we think because most of the equipments we use were originally created by those people .
The fast and growing computer industry is giving us less and less physical work due to a mechanical concept .
Biotechnology is providing us with the latested discoveries to heal or improve the human body to its most efficient state .
Transport means are also part of the overall technology and allow us to go faster , further than before with less effort .
Besides all those improvements and confort I ca n't stop thinking where all this will lead us .
I am keen on technology because I believe it should improve our lives however I dislike the idea that such a science might fall or had already fallen in wicked hands .
Dear manager ,
I am writing to complain about the musical show which was held last week .
I feel disappointed because it was different to the advertisement .
First of all , the performers should be Danny Brook and Tina Truelove .
However , there were two unknown actors in the show .
I feel most disappointed about this .
The show was started at 20.15 but actually it should started at 19.30 .
Moreover , I bought a £ 20 ticket without any discount even the advertisement mentioned discount is available .
And after the show , we went to visit the theatre restaurant .
Unfortunately , it was closed because at that day was their day-off .
But I am wondering why it said we could visit the restaurant if you know it would be closed .
I am afraid it was not a best musical show because all the things above was not an accurate as what we had been told .
On the whole , I feel disappointed about the event and I would have my money back .
I look forward to hearing your reply .
Thank you .
Your faithfully ,
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
I say this because of the experience I 've had from her .
Actually , we were quite good friends before the event happened .
Pat has been studying in the same class with me since this year .
She is sitting next to me , we started to chat more and more , then we became good friends .
One day , we were sitting in the dinning-hall like usually .
Suddenly my heart was thumbing so quickly because I saw him ? - A boy who is a new student .
I know this is one right love ,
I 'm absolutely besorrted of him .
Then I told this to Pat and told her to keep it secret : I did n't want people gossip behind me then everyone would know I fancy him .
But the thing which I 've never expected is Pat betrayed me .
She told everyone that I fancy him and everybody always make joke on it , that makes me feel so embarrised : I was very angry at that time !
Now , I do n't talk to her anymore because I ca n't stand a person who I trusted betrayed me .
I hope she would know that was her fault and do n't do it anymore .

Dear Maria Smith ,
I receved your letter and I 'm happy to help you .
We booked the Palace Hotel for your group , it 's nice and quiet .
I 'm sure you 'll be fine here .
We chose the Palace Hotel because it 's near our college , too .
So you are going to come at the conference in some minutes .
When you go out of the Hotel turn right and go stright on , at the first crossroads turn right again .
At the end of this street you can see our college on your left , it 's a green building .
At the end-of-conference party it 'll be something to eat and to drink .
In the big room where we 'll have the party , it 'll be some picturs of our college , you 'll see al the generations who passed here .
The wears are n't very important , but it 'll be fine if the people will wear something different from the usual jeans .
Here we have a lot of beautiful things to do , but the best you can do in about three hours is visiting the painting museum .
We all are looking forward to seeing your group .
Yours sincerely ,
Television
What would our world be without television ?
It is n't easy giving an answer at this question .
Television is an important invention , it permitted us to better our way of communication .
This animated box can give us a lot of informations coming from all around the world .
Television has affected the " all days life " , too .
We can spend a lot of time enjoying ourselves with some programs , all what we have to do is watching .
And we like that , because it 's easier nothing doing than engaging ourselves in something that make us do something .
So television can be a positive or a negative invention , it depends on which use we want to do of this box .
Now we should be able to answer at the introducing question .
No , I do n't think so .
Television has become so important for us that we ca n't thinking that it could n't exist .
Dear Sir / Madam ,
Thank you very much .
I am very glad I have won first prize in the competition - two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A.
I would like to travel only in July , because in June I have to study at school which has n't finished until the end of June .
In August , I have already made another appointment with my friends .
We are going to visit the places of interest of China , as usual , our new term begins in September .
I only can travel in July
Accommodation I would prefer in tents to in log cabins .
Tents are very easy to take and go everywhere .
What 's more , in my opinion it is very romantic .
I am good at singing and photography .
I can sing most kinds of songs , such as pop music , folk .
I like taking photograph , in my only room .
There are all kinds of photos , for example , beach , sea trees and so on .
In the end , I wonder what kind of clothes I should take and how much money I should bring with me .
I look forward to seeing you soon .
Yours faithfully

Subject : which lessons and other activities should be filmed
Instruction :
The aim of this report is to suggest which lessons and lessons be filmed into a short video .
In order to write the report I interviewed about one hundred students who are studying in our English class .
Results :
The majority of them said it 's a good idea to make something about Maths and English study skills .
Sixty percent recommended that the activity which called make the brain up in the morning class should be filmed .
Ten of them said should make the computing .
Two thirds said we should film a part of playing football .
Reasons :
Although Maths is very boring , it is very important in nowadays .
English is the most popular language in the world , what 's more , more and more people start to learn English .
The activity of making brain up can help us remember new words .
Playing football is good for health .
Conclusion :
It is recommended that should be filmed about Maths , English study skills , make brain up and a part of playing football .

Mr Smith ,
I write you because last friday I had a very disappointing evening in your theatre .
I went there because I had read a banner about the musical show " Over the rainbow " , but many informations were wrong .
Last week I was in London with my friends and we decided to go to the theatre to see how the famous Danny Brook act .
But when we arrived at 2.00 pm to see the show of 2.30 p.m. , we could n't enter in the theatre because the discounts were n't available .
So we returned in the evening and we waited 45 minutes until the beginning of the show !
No only : we had the bad surprise that Brook had been substituded by another actor !
I ask you if is it possible to have my money back , please , because I want to forgot that expense .
Thank you .
Yours faithfully
Modern technology ca n't not transforme our daily life .
The inventions of the airplane , of the train and of the car , have reduced the distances of the world , so we can go to the other side of the world in half a day .
It means that daily life is faster and busier because I 'm able to go to school in the morning and then to play soccer in the afternoon , and after few minutes I can stay in the other side of Lecce to play piano with my musical band , then I can go back home when I want , listening the notices about what happens around the world with the radio of my car .
So I have must more interestings things to do in my life .
But the most important innovation of technology development is the computer .
In everytime of the day I can communicate with people of all nationality of the world , I can have informations about everything , I can buy something which I ca n't find in the shops of my town , so I can do anything just clicking on the mouse !
Sadly , there is also a negative aspect .
Sometimes , computer substitudes real relationships between people .
In fact , many boys pass several hours in front of their computer and the forgive that out of their houses there are their friends ....
In conclusion , I think that modern technology get my life more interesting , but I prefer to stay with my friends and with my girlfriend then in front of a computer !
Dear Sir ,
I 've recently visited London for holidays and during my stay I went to your theatre to see the musical show " Over the Rainbow " .
I am really sorry to say that I am very disappointed about the whole organisation of the musical , starting from the advertisement .
Firstly , in the advertisement it says that the main actor was supposed to be Danny Brook . An actor that I admire and I wanted to see him performing .
Unfortunately instead of Brook I saw another actor , totally stranger to me .
Secondly in the advertisement the starting time of the musical was said to be at 19:30 , but the theatre started at 20:15 .
I do n't want to be rude , but this is not proffessional at all .
Another thing I would like to mention is the discount that we were supposed to have on the tickets .
There was n't any discount .
Lastly I would like to inform you that I wanted to have dinner at yor restaurant but they told me it was closed because it usually closes at 11:00 o'clock. and the musical finished at 11:30 .
And I am asking you : Why do you adverstise it if is not going to be available for the audience ?
I am closing this letter by saying you that that night was the most terrible night of my holidays and that I would like to have my money back , please
I hope you will reply to my letter .
Regards
Xx
How has modern technology changed your daily life .
We are living in the 21st century where everybody is surrounded by advanced technological methods .
As a result of all these advanced technological methods , I became one of the daily users of modern technology .
Of course using modern technology has both advantages and disadvantages .
The first thing that came to my life and changed it completely is the computer .
I spend most of my time in front of the computer , either working or playing .
Of course this sometimes is an advantage , when for example the computer helps me to do my job easier , but some other times it is a great disadvantage because it keeps me away from my friends .
But unfortunately I cannot live without a computer .
The first thing I do in the morning is start up my computer , check if I have any new e-mails , check my electronic calendar and then go to work , where I always work with a computer .
The computer has become my second nature .
And not only the computer .
Everyday I use the microwave for heating my food and of course .
I always carry with me my mobile phone .
One of the greatest technological achievements and I am afraid to say that I cannot live without my mobile phone .
In conclusion I would like to say that modern technology is offering to the humanity to many things , some of them are good and some others are not so good .
It 's up to us if we can use those technological achievements in the right way , and make our lives easier .
The only thing I really support is that if you know how to use technology is a benefit for you .
If you do n't is going to destroy you .
Dear Mrs Smith ,
I am writting you to reply your question about the conference in London. thank you for your letter .
I am very pleasant to know you decided to come to the " II International conference of Human Rights " which will be celebrated in Albert Hall college next 25 of June .
I would like to inform you that the group you belong to , has been booked in Palace Hotel , in the center of London from the 24 June until 25 of June .
The Albert Hall College , the building where will be taken part the conference is sited near Green Park Avenue ; so , to get it from the Palace Hotel you can take the bus number 26 , otherwise , you can take the Picadilly Line from South Kensigton Station to green Park station .
It takes about 10 minutes .
Therefore , that 's the faster way of transport you can choose .
The Conference will start at 9 am of 25 June and will finish about 6 pm in the same day .
During the day is supposed having a break of half and hour at 12 p.m and finally , a party for all the people who will be there .
That will be a smart party and because of this , it will be required a well-dressed and immaculate presence .
Ladies should wear an evening dress and gentlman a dark suit .
As I can see from your letter , you will have about three hours before you catch your plane , so , I would suggest to visit The Tate Modern Museum , where you will can find several interesting pictures such as Dali 's Warhols .
If you need some more information or details about he conference , you can contact Alexia on 0033 *** phone .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours sincerely ,
Introduction
The aim of this report is giving some suggestions to a group of American students who has just arrived in Rome and want some information about an interesting building to visit .
Rome is a big city where they can find several moments and important buildings , for this reason I would suggest them to visit
1 ) " Fontana di Trevi " sited in Trevis Square in the center of Rome .
That 's a small square where there is a fountain very big .
It was built by Canovas architect in 1638 .
That is the fountain which " Dolce Vita " film was taken place .
2 ) For other hand , there is Villa Borghese Building ,
That is a museum where they can find the most important sculptures and pictures of Antonio Canovas and , Bernini , who stayed for a long time working in Rome .
Conclusion
I would recommend them the buildings because :
1 ) First of all , there are sited in the center of Rome so , they can take a bus to get them move and around the city .
2 ) Secondly , they can enjoy visiting museums , and afterwards they can take something to eat or to drink in the " pizzerias ' and restaurants near these famous places .
In conclusion , they could combine art , the history and the night visiting one only place without spend much money .
17th JUNE 2000 .
Dear sir ,
I am writing to complain about the problems which occurred in the last musical show of this theatre .
First of all , differently of advertised , the main actor was not danny brook , but other unknown person .
To make matter worse , the show delayed starting at 20:15 .
As if this were not enough , i did not obtain a discount in the price of the ticket , although this was possible according to your leaflet .
On top of everything , i could not visit the restaurant of this place , because it was closed after the show .
I am very disappointed , because that evening out was not perfect as i had planned .
So , i would be grateful if you could refund of all or part of my money which i paid for the show .
I look forward to receiving your prompt reply .
Yours faithfully ,
Marcos almo bras de barodo .
It 's undenyable that during this century our world has been changing .
News invents have been invented and the science has been in quick progress .
As a result of this people 's daily life has been changing as well .
As far as i 'm concerned , i firmly believe that , it 's worth to pointing out the following :
First and foremost , it 's important to remember that today it is easier to travel around the world because nowadays there are lots of good and fast ways of transport .
In the same way , we can travel inside our country quickly and safely .
Consequently , we 've got facilities to know many different places and to contact different people , too .
Secondly , we ca n't forget either that all of us have conditions to communicate with people by mobile phones , by internet , who live not only in this country , but also abroad .
Finally , we can consider , too , that the technology has been providing us with important discoveries , mainly in matters about health , environment and so on .
In conclusion , i really believe that our daily life is very different than it was in the last century and even in the beggining of this century .
The science and the technology are the main responsible for this .
Dear Maria ,
I 've recieved your letter asking me for further information about the conference that you going to organise very soon , here yo have a little help for it .
At first , I 'd like to tell you that the hotel where you going to stay is " The Palace Hotel " , wich is situated at the center of the town .
It ca n't be difficult to find , because is very near of the conference .
Also there is a bus provided for the organisation to take all the students at the hotel .
At the end of the conference it will be a party .
I might suggest you to wear a casual dress , because many students feels relaxing after the whole day sitting and listening all the conference .
The party is amazed by a group of musicians , and as I remembered from last year it was unforgiven , because all the people where dancing and having a lot of fun .
It is a well-situated town with a lot of museums to visit especially " the History museum " wich I visited last year , and I think you can enjoy as well .
It does n't take a lot of time to visit and the entrance is free .
Whising I 've been very helpful to you .
Yours sincerely ,
Telephone change our lifes
It 's imposible Nowdays to think a life without that invention how quickly affects our life especially in business .
We ca n't imagine a big company without a phone , that can makes business more quickly than anything else .
Also , I was asking too many people in the street .
Could you live without telephone ?
The answer was all the same " Imposible ". An old woman told me how important was the phone when her only son was abroad studing computers in the " Chicago University " , she told me that every night was expecting a call from her son , for her was the line of the hapiness .
However it was one persone wich he told me , it was n't happy at all with the phone , because he used to writte a lot , especially at Christmas to wish all his friends a very nice Christmas but now everybody phone him losing a very old fashion .
In my opinion this little " box " that everybody has at home can safe your life , especially if you need to ring a doctor in an emergency situation .
In conclusion do n't make a very long phone calls and you wo n't have to pay a very expensive bill .
Dear Sir / Madam ,
During my stay in London I decided to see a musical show called " OVER THE RAINBOW " but , unfortunately I was very disappointed .
At first , as I have read in your advertisement , Danny Brook should have stared in this show .
A different actor has appeared , but I must say that he was very disappointing .
Secondly , you have written that the musical starts at 19:30 .
I had to wait for the show for over fourty five minutes , because it started at about 20:15 !
What is more , it has been written that I can get some discounts , but when I wanted to buy a cheaper ticket , it was impossible .
You have also placed a note about your theatre restaurant opened after the show .
I wanted to drink a coffee but , unfortunately it was closed , because the waiter went out !
To sum up , I must say that this evening out was supposed to be perfect .
It was not of course , so I would like to ask you kindly for my money back , because some information placed in your advertisement about the musical was not true .
Your faithfully ,
In my opinion modern technology has changed my daily life very much .
At first , there are now a lot of things that most people use at home .
For example : a fridge , a cooker or just an electricity .
We could n't imagine our life without them .
Secondly , thanked to the technology , there are many ways of travelling today .
We produce cars , trains and plains which are better and better .
What is more , there are many new ways to produce medicines and modern hospital equipement .
It can really help a lot to cure people .
Maybe it will be a remedium against AIDs or cancer soon .
On the other hand , the modern technology has some disadvantages .
The main is the ozone hole that affects all the people in the world .
The second is the nuclear weapon and many wars , in which modern equipement is used .
To sum up , as far as I am concidered , modern technology has changed my life completely .
On the one hand it helps me a lot in daily life , but on the other I 'm afraid of the future everyday .
Dear Helen Ryan ,
I would like to thank you for your letter !
I went in for your competition and I was really anxious about the results .
I am surprised that I won the first prize but also very happy about it !
Therefore it would be my pleasure to reply to your letter .
Firstly , I would like to arrive at the Camp in July if that is possible because I am working and I will not have spare time before this month .
Secondly , you are mentioning " tents or log cabins " as the accommodation provided .
I would rather live in a tent than a log cabin in order to be close to nature
I adore the sound of the wind , trees , animals and everything which is surrounding .
I could feel the environment .
Thirdly , as far as the activities I have to choose , I would prefer swimming as well as tennis .
I have gained some experience in playing tennis due to the tennis court that we used to have at home .
I do sports a lot so apart from tennis I am a member in our local swimming centre .
I can reasure you that gradually I am improving my sports skills .
Finally , I would like to ask you which kind of clothes do I have to bring with me .
Is the weather changeable ?
I was also wondering if I will need any money .
I would appreciate if you could let me know as soon as possible .
I hope the information given will be of use .
I have tried to be as helpful as possible .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours sincerely ,
Dear Kim ,
I am writing to you about my previous experience .
I know how impatient you are about it and I just want to let you know that it was something amazing !
As I 've told you , last month I went at a pop concert and I really enjoy helping with the preparation .
It took place in a huge stadium which had over 4.000 seats for the " spactetors " if you can call them like this .
Can you imagine ?
There was a large stage which we had to clean by sweeping .
That was a little bit odd but and funny at the same time .
Another thing we had to do was help the staff to tranfer some equipment .
The musicians brough it in order to achieve a high standard of quality sound .
We had to be very careful .
Have you any idea how much does this stuff worth ?
You do n't even want to know .
Apart from these we were mainly helping the singers to be prepared for the concert .
They had to chose their clothes , give one last performance before the big night and everything had to be perfect !
Even if I could use 100 sheets it would n't be enough to describe my experience and the things that I 've gained through it !
I 've learned the meaning of the words " reliability " and " responsibility ". Anyway the result of the whole preparation is far more enjoyable and relaxing .
Looking forward to hearing from you .
Best wishes
Dear Madam ,
At first , I want to say how I am happy to have won this prize and I want to thank you .
Concerning the information you want I will give them .
I would like to travel on July because this is the only month given to me by my employer .
I would prefer to have a log cabin because I can not sleep in a tent ( it is too hot and the floor is too hard for my back ) .
Concerning the two activities I have to choose , I would prefer to swim and play tennis ( I have a good level in each sports ) .
Finally I would like to know how much money I have to prepare and which sorts of clothes are usually weared in California .
Yours faithfully
Pablo Fernandez
Many classes and activities are important in our school
But I have to make a choice in order to select them
The class of mecanics seem to be the more important lesson .
It use a lot of technics that we learn in other classes .
It gives us the knowledge usefull for many school club like the " marathon shell " club or the robotich club .
Besides it gives all the areas covered by a mecanic ingenier and it is very important in a school where you will probably become a mecanic ingenier
It lets us specify our abilities in the part of mecanics that we prefer .
But there are other lessons very important ( like English of course ! )
Actually , I have a regret , there is no ethic lessons ,
It would show us how use our knowledge .
Dear Mrs. Helen
I 'm writing back to answer the questions that you send me in the past letter , so refering to the question of when I would like to travel , I would like to go anytime during july , because I have to be in august back home , because I need to apply and get everithing sortted out , to go into college next september .
And according to the question of wich type of accommodation I prefer , I choose a log cabin , because I think that the tent is more messy , so I would appreciate if you give me the cabin .
And my answer to the question of wich activities I would like to choose , well I choose swimming cause is my daily excercise and surfing .
Anyway I 'm not very good doing surfing but with a little bit of help I know I can make it .
Oh , for last I just would like to ask you how many clothes , and money I have to bring with me .
And well Mrs Helen I would really apprecciatte if you send me back a letter with all the answers of my question , anyway .
Thank you very very much and please keep in contact by e-mail , as normal mail .
Yours trully

Dear Mrs Helen Ryan ,
I received your letter last week and was surprised to see that I won a competition .
It is the first time it happens to me .
Unfortunately I 'm free only in July .
Actually I will be busy working abroad until the end of June and will be on holidays with my family in August .
You asked me which accomodation I would prefer .
It 's ages since I have been sleeping in a tent and I would be happy to experiment it again .
It will remind me some wonderful experiences .
According to the activities , I would like to do some painting , which I am quite good at .
The second activity I chose is sailing .
I went two times on a sailing ship without doing anything , therefore have I got no experience at all .
May I ask you how much money do I need and which sort of clothes do you advise me to take ?
I look forward to your answer and to the camp , naturally .
Yours sincerely
Dear Kim ,
Thank you very much for your last letter .
As you asked me in your letter , I will try to explain my wonderful experience at this pop concert .
First of all you have to know that it was n't a common pop concert , but a real open air festival .
It is n't the first year that I work there .
However this year was n't like last year .
My job was as simple as selling ice-creams .
You might say that it is quite boring , but it was so funny .
Everybody was so relaxed ; we were singing and dancing while selling ice-creams in our little van .
Byran Adams himself bought me an ice-cream .
It was amazing experience .
What I particularly liked about it was that the staff was like a big family .
Everybody was ready to help each other .
I was really impressed by this solidarity and friendship which is quite rare in Switzerland .
I look forward to hearing from you and wish you all the best .
Love from
Sir Robertson ,
We are really appriciate about giving very nice program , which is organised by your this time .
Especially River trip to Greenwich makes us very excited and we are really looking to forwold to his .
By the way , on 14th of March LONDON Fashion Show and Leisure show will hold at Central Exhibition Hall .
We are very interested in this .
We have a great opportunity to learn latest fashion free because of students .
Therefore if you could change the program on 14th , we would be very happy .
Could you consider this for us ?
We 're looking forwold to your reply .
Thank you .
Faithfully ,
your students .
The Home of the Future .
As developing modern society , we will become to have more material than now . Invent glass was very eventuly to architect .
Architecuture with use of grass brough us the modenism in 1980 .
In the future we can expect having new material and it will make our living more confortable and convinient .
In Japan , crime of minority is increasing .
It said that as one of the reasons small separete room makes kids unsociable and dissapointed .
Therefore Japanese architect consider designing of use many glasses as much as they can in house and try not to create speparate dark room .
Otherwise as producing new electoronic , our home of future will be more convinient .
On the other hand inside of the house will be too simple .
Although high might be still same . Because human high wo n't change so much , unless 10000 years passed .
Dear Sir or Madam
I am writing to complain about the musical show which is called OVER THE RAINBOW .
I saw the show on 17th of July .
Firstly , the advertisement claimed discount ticket was available .
Although I have a student card for discounts I could not get any discount .
So I had to buy a normal ticket .
Secondly , I bought a second musical show ticket which start at 19:30 but it started at 20:15 .
As a result , I had to wait over one hour as I arrived there at 19:00 .
Thirdly , your advertisement misled I could see Danny Brook in the show who I adore .
When I turned up the show , there was another actor instead of him .
Fourthly , after the show the theatre restaurant was closed because of it 's problems .
But I could go evening out .
To sum up , I believe your advertisement completely misled .
So I am fully entitled to ask for refund except for evening out .
I hope this matter will recieve your prompt attention .
yours faithfully

Nowadays , mordern technology has increasingly been developing .
We get many advantages which make improve our lives daily , on the other hands , we get also many disadvantages which could harm us .
In my opinion , the main advantage is developing of medical technology .
For example , if you were hurt seriously like cutting leg , the new medical technology could rebuilit part of your body .
Another advantage is sharing information .
The more developing the technology is , the quicker and easier international networking is .
So at the same time many people can share some information even though they live in different country .
In contrast , the technology can cause a pollution .
By developing of transport , we can get wherever you want to go easily , however it could cause serious air pollution like acid-rain and smog .
Also we should be careful as we could be watched by security carmera which has been combined with mordern technology .
In conculsion , I conciderly said we has been charged by morder technology in two way .
One is advantage and the other is disadvantage .
And it will change our lives , also in the future .
Dear Madam :
I just receive your letter with the good news .
I am very happy for winning the first prize in your competition and I am glad to tell you that I am planning to go but I can only travel on July because I have to work until the end of June .
For the accommodation I would like to have log cabins rather than tents because two weeks is quite a long time and I think they are more comfortable and give you more privacy .
I enjoy swimming and singing and I would like to join others in these activities .
I am an average swimmer and as a singer I am not a start but it would be fun to share my songs with the holiday makers .
Can you please give me some recomendations about the clothes I will need and also the cost of the food there to make my budget .
Thank you for these wonderful two weeks at Camp California .
Yours faithfully
Shopping is not always enjoyable
In my opinion shopping sometimes is really boring specially when you buy at the supermarkets almost all the time the same things like cleaning products and the ingredients for every day food .
On the other hand everything looks different if I have to make a present for someone in my family .
I start thinking what she or he prefer and I try my best buying something apropiate does n't matter how much money does it cost .
In conclusion most of the time that you spend shopping you put a lot of effort choosing things and making decissions and they are more or less important , or more or less enjoyable depends on what , why , where and who is the person that you are interested to please .
Dear Mrs Ryan
Many thanks for your letter .
I would like to travel in July because I have got summer holidays from July to August and I work as a bank clerk in August .
I think a tent would suit my personal life-style better than a log cabin because I love the nature .
I would like to play basketball during my holidays at Camp California because I love this game .
I have been playing basketball for 8 years and today I am a member of an Austrian basketball-team .
But I have never played golf in my life but with your help I would be able to learn how to play golf and I think this could be very interesting .
I also would like to know how much money I will get from you for those two weeks because I would like to spend some money for clothes .
I am looking forward to hearing from you soon .
Yours sincerely
Dear Kim
Last month I enjoyed helping at a pop concert and I think you want to hear some funny stories about the experience I made .
At first I had to clean the three private rooms of the stars .
This was very boring but after I left the third room I met Brunner and Brunner .
These two people are stars in our country ...
O.K. I am just kiding .
I do n't like the songs of Brunner and Brunner because this kind of music is very boring .
I also had to clean the washing rooms .
I will never ever help anybody to organice a pop concert .
But after this serville work I met Eminem .
I think you know his popular songs like " My Name Is " .
It was one of the greatest moments in my life .
I had to bring him something to eat .
It was a hard but also a funny work .
You should try to called some experience during such a concert you would not regret it .
I am looking forward to hearing from you soon .
Dear Sir ,
I am writing to complain about the musical show 'OVER THE RAINBOW' I attended three days ago .
I was very disappointed with the performance and apart from that there were many problems .
Firstly , the start time was at 19.30 p.m , but the play started at 20.15 p.m .
People were fed up with waiting so long and most of them apart from me were rather nervous .
Secondly , the well-known star Danny Brook was n't there , but a different actor I had never heard from him .
From my point of view I think he was such a very bad actor that was impossible to fine another with the same features .
As far as the tickets is concerned no discounts were available , so , moreover I found it expensive .
After the show I went to visit the restaurant as it is said it is very famous and apart from that I wanted to have a drink .
At the end I had to go home as it was closed because the coffee pot did not work .
What nonsense !
The evening was a disaster and I wonder if I have not the right to ask you for returning my money , as I think it is fair .
I look forward to hearing from you ,
Yours faithfully ,
Maria gardent
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
But this time things have gone too far .
I 've know Pat since we were kids .
Little by little we were growing up and becaming close friends .
I relyied on her and our relationship was excellent .
I considered her my best friend and I thought we would never drift apart but now my mind have changed , because she has done something I ca n't approve .
She has given away to my mother that I told her a lie as far as the weekend was concerned .
Pat told her I had n't spent those days with her , but with my boyfriend in the mountain .
My mother was so hungry and she told off me so hard that I will remember it the rest of my life .
Moreover I was punished hardly by my father and now we do n't talk each other .
Since then I have n't seen Pat anymore and she seems not regret that happened , so I 'll try to forget her and carry on my life that 's all .
To the manger of the Circle Theatre Mr Smith
Caen , Saturday June 17th
Mr Smith ,
I have recently been to London on a holiday trip so I decided to spend my free-time going to the musical show you were advertising for .
It seemed very attractive and the different informations on the ad pushed me into going to it .
Unfortunately , I 've been really disappointed .
I 'm not keen on liars Mr Smith and I think that you 've lied to such naive tourist like us : some brilliant actors were supposed to play the part and we only had different and pityful ones .
Moreover the show was expected to begin at 19.30 but it was delayed of forty-five minutes .
