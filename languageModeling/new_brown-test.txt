<s> as letch's antisocial conduct increased , our invitations decreased and my heart was in my mouth whenever i played hostess at a fashionable `` screenland '' gathering . </s>
<s> between 1935 and 1939 letch and i made ten films together , each less successful , both artistically and commercially , than the one before it . </s>
<s> our last joint venture , sainted lady , a deeply religious film based on the life of mother cabrini , and timed so that its release date would coincide with the beatification of america's first saint in november , 1938 , was a fiasco from start to finish . </s>
<s> as i was playing mother cabrini , the picture was actually `` all mine '' , with nearly every scene built around me . </s>
<s> but in order to keep letch in the public eye and out of trouble , i wrote in a part especially for him -- that of a dashing ruffian who `` sees the light '' and is saved by the inspiring example of mother cabrini . </s>
<s> and did he appreciate my efforts on his behalf ? ? </s>
<s> did he trouble to memorize the very small part which i had `` tailor-made '' to his specifications , a role eventually cut down to three short speeches ? ? </s>
<s> did he show the rest of the cast -- numbering four thousand -- the consideration of arriving at the studio punctually -- or even at all ? ? </s>
<s> he did not ! ! </s>
<s> the `` shooting '' went on for eight months ! ! </s>
<s> most of our working days were spent on the telephone calling `` bookies '' , illegal gambling dens , a certain `` residential club for young actresses '' , more than a hundred different bars or the steam room of the athletic club . </s>
<s> whenever he deigned to appear at the studio he was `` hung over '' , uncooperative , rude and insulting . </s>
<s> he made many tasteless , irreverent and unfunny remarks , not only about me in the title role , but about religion in general . </s>
<s> by the time the film was released we were three million dollars over-spent , war was imminent and the public apparently had forgotten all about mother cabrini . </s>
<s> thanks to letch feeley and the terrible strain he imposed on me , the notices were few and unfavorable . </s>
<s> only george santayana seemed to understand and appreciate the film when he wrote : `` miss poitrine has perpetrated the most eloquent argument for the protestant faith yet unleashed by hollywood '' . </s>
<s> but it was small consolation . </s>
<s> in a rare fit of anger and spite , i `` farmed out '' my own husband to a small and most undistinguished studio to make one picture as a form of punishment . </s>
<s> ( an actor must have discipline . </s>

<s> it turned out to be a life of martin luther , of all things ! ! </s>
<s> it was a disaster ! ! </s>
<s> in clothes , letch simply did not project . </s>
<s> he was laughed off the screen . </s>
<s> at the same time , however , i availed myself of the services of that great english actor and master of make-up , sir gauntley pratt , to do a `` quickie '' called the mystery of the mad marquess , in which i played a young american girl who inherits a haunted castle on the english moors which is filled with secret passages and sliding panels and , unbeknownst to anyone , is still occupied by an eccentric maniac . </s>
<s> it was a `` potboiler '' made on a `` shoestring '' and not the sort of film i like , as all i had to do was look blank and scream a great deal . </s>
<s> my heart was not in it , but , oddly enough , it remains the most financially successful picture of my career . </s>
<s> ( i watched it on television late one night last week and it `` stands up '' remarkably well , even twenty years later . </s>
<s> ) </s>
<s> letch had returned from his debacle unrepentant and more badly behaved than before . </s>
<s> i really loved that boy , and , in a feverish attempt to preserve our marriage and to try to revive the wonderful , wonderful person letch had once been , i took my troubles to momma , hoping that her earthy advice would help me . </s>
<s> `` if i could only think of something at the studio , near me , to absorb his boundless energy '' , i said . </s>
<s> `` what is letch interested in '' ? ? </s>
<s> `` bookies , booze and babes '' , momma said bluntly . </s>
<s> her reply stung me , but this was too important to let my hurt make any difference . </s>
<s> `` i can't turn the studio into a gambling hell or a saloon '' , i said . </s>
<s> up to date , however , his garden was still more or less of a mess , he hadn't even started his workshop and if there was a meadow pond in the neighborhood he hadn't found it . </s>
<s> it wasn't his fault that these things were so . </s>
<s> the difficulty was that each day seemed to produce its quota of details which must be cleaned up immediately . </s>
<s> as a result , life had become a kind of continuous make-ready . </s>
<s> once he disposed of these items which screamed so harshly for attention , he could undertake the things which really counted . </s>
<s> then , at last , his day would fall into an ordered pattern and he would be free to read , or garden or just wander through the woods in the late afternoon , accompanied by his dogs . </s>
<s> his dogs ? ? </s>
<s> he had almost forgotten them , although they had played such an important part in his early dreams . </s>
<s> then they had always been romping around him on these walks , yelping with delight , dashing off into the bushes on fruitless hunting expeditions , returning to jump up on him triumphantly with muddy paws . </s>
<s> dogs did something to one's ego . </s>
<s> they were constantly assuring you that you were one of the world's great guys . </s>
<s> regardless of how much of a slob you knew yourself to be , you could be certain they would never find out -- and even if they did it would make no difference . </s>
<s> now it became increasingly apparent that there were to be no dogs in the picture . </s>
<s> what in the world were you going to do with a lot of dogs when you left for town on monday afternoons ? ? </s>
<s> you certainly couldn't take them into the little apartment and if you tried to farm them out for two or three days every week they would become so confused that they would have nervous breakdowns . </s>
<s> why in the world couldn't he live in one place the way everyone else seemed to ? ? </s>
<s> it worried him , this inability to get the simplest things done in the course of a day . </s>
<s> he would wake up in the middle of the night and fret about it . </s>
<s> how in the world had he formerly found time to build up a business , raise a family , be on half a dozen boards , work actively on committees and either go out in the evening or plow through the contents of a bulging brief case ? ? </s>
<s> was it possible that as people grow older the nature of time changed ? ? </s>
<s> could it be that it speeded up for the aged in some mysterious way , as if a bored universe were skipping through the end of the chapter just to get it over with ? ? </s>
<s> or was the answer less metaphysical ? ? </s>
<s> did older people work more slowly ? ? </s>
<s> did it take a man of sixty-five longer to write a letter , shave , clean out a barn , read a newspaper , than a man of thirty ? ? </s>
<s> did men become perfectionists as they grew older , polishing , polishing , reluctant to let go ? ? </s>
<s> it might be that certain people were born with a compulsion to complicate their lives , while others could live blissfully motionless almost indefinitely , like lizards in the sun , too indolent to blink their eyes . </s>
<s> perhaps it was his misfortune , or good fortune , whichever way one looked at it , to belong to the former group , and he was struggling unconsciously to build up pressure in a world which demanded none , which was positively antagonistic to it . </s>
<s> and then again perhaps the reason why he couldn't find time to do any of the things he had planned to do after retirement : reading , roaming , gardening , lying on his back and watching the clouds go by , was because he didn't want to do them . </s>
<s> there was no compulsion behind them . </s>
<s> they could be done or left undone and nobody really gave a damn . </s>
<s> during all his busy life he had only done things which had to be done . </s>
<s> this habit had become so fixed over the years that it seemed futile to do anything for which no one was waiting . </s>
<s> he looked at the luminous dial of his wrist watch . </s>
<s> it was five minutes after four . </s>
<s> on some distant farm a rooster crowed and , far down the valley , an associate answered . </s>
<s> he turned over impatiently and pulled the sheet over his head against the treacherous encroachment of the dawn . </s>
<s> at least he could buy the equipment for his workshop . </s>
<s> thus committed , action might follow . </s>
<s> he went down to mills and bradley's hardware store and bought a full set of carpenter's tools , including a rotary power saw and several other pieces of power machinery that mr. mills said were essential for babbiting and doweling , whatever they were . </s>
<s> he also bought a huge square of pegboard for hanging up his tools , and lumber for his workbench , sandpaper and glue and assorted nails , levels and t squares and plumb lines and several gadgets that he had no idea how to use or what they were for . </s>
<s> `` there '' , said mr. mills . </s>
<s> `` that'll get you started . </s>
<s> best not to get everything at once . </s>
<s> add things as you find you need 'em '' . </s>
<s> he didn't even ask the cost of this collection . </s>
<s> after all , if you were going to set up a workshop you had to have the proper equipment and that was that . </s>
<s> when he returned home , the station wagon loaded with tools , jinny had gone with a friend to some meeting in the village , using the recently purchased second car . </s>
<s> he was glad . </s>
<s> it gave him a chance to unload the stuff and get it down to the cellar without a barrage of acid comments . </s>
<s> he had made such a fuss about buying that second car that he knew he was vulnerable . </s>
<s> he piled everything neatly in a corner of the cellar and turned to stare at the blank stone wall . </s>
<s> that was where the pegboard would go on which he would hang his hand tools . </s>
<s> in front of it would be his workbench . </s>
<s> the old nightmare which had caused him so many wakeful hours came charging in on him once more , only this time he couldn't pacify it with a sleeping pill and send it away . </s>
<s> how in the world did one attach a pegboard to a stone wall ? ? </s>
<s> how did one attach anything to a stone wall , for that matter ? ? </s>
<s> after the pegboard there would be the paneling . </s>
<s> he sat down on an old box and focused on the problem . </s>
<s> perhaps one bored holes in the stone with some kind of an electric gadget . </s>
<s> but then , when you stuck things into the holes , why didn't they come right out again ? ? </s>
<s> it all seemed rather hopeless . </s>
<s> he turned his attention to the workbench . </s>
<s> perhaps that was the first thing to do . </s>
<s> a workbench had a heavy top and sturdy legs , but how did you attach sturdy legs to a heavy top so that the whole thing didn't wobble like a newborn calf and ultimately collapse when you leaned on it ? ? </s>
<s> mr. mills had done some figuring on a scrap of paper and given him the various kinds of boards and two-by-fours which , properly handled , would , he had assured him , turn into a workbench . </s>
<s> they lay on the cellar floor in a disorderly pile . </s>
<s> mr. crombie poked at it gingerly with his foot . </s>
<s> how could anyone know what to do with an assortment like that ? ? </s>
<s> perhaps he had better have someone help him put up the pegboard and build the workbench -- someone who knew what he was about . </s>
<s> then at least he would have a place to hang his tools and something to work on . </s>
<s> after that everything should be simpler . </s>
<s> he went upstairs to phone crumb . </s>
<s> to his amazement he reached him . </s>
<s> mr. crumb was laid up with a bad cold . </s>
<s> he didn't seem to think that attaching a pegboard to a stone wall was much of a problem and he tossed off the building of the worktable equally lightly . </s>
<s> the only trouble was that he himself was tied up on the school job . </s>
<s> that was why he hadn't been able to finish the porch . </s>
<s> no , he didn't know of any handyman-carpenter . </s>
<s> there wasn't any such thing any more . </s>
<s> carpenters all wanted steady work and at the moment every mother's son for twenty miles around that could hammer nails for twenty-five dollars a day was working on the school job . </s>
<s> there was a fellow named blatz over smithtown way . </s>
<s> nobody liked to hire him because you never could tell when he was going to be taken drunk . </s>
<s> mr. crumb would probably see him at lodge meeting the next night . </s>
<s> if he was sober , which was doubtful , he'd have him get in touch with mr. crombie . </s>
<s> mr. blatz had been at least sober enough to remember to telephone and he turned out to be the greatest boon that had come into mr. crombie's life since he moved to highfield , in spite of the fact that he didn't work very fast or very long at a time , and he didn't like to work at all unless mr. crombie hung around and talked to him . </s>
<s> he said he was the lonely type and working in a cellar you saw funny things coming out of the cracks in the wall if they wasn't nobody with you . </s>
<s> so mr. crombie sat on a wooden box and talked in order to keep mr. blatz's mind from funny things . </s>
<s> at the same time he watched carefully to see how one attached pegboards to stone walls , but mr. blatz was usually standing in his line of vision and it all seemed so simple that he didn't like to disclose his ignorance . </s>
<s> while mr. blatz was putting up the pegboards and starting the workbench , mr. crombie told him of this idea about paneling the whole end of the cellar . </s>
<s> mr. blatz agreed that this would be pretty . </s>
<s> without further discussion he appeared the next morning with a pile of boards sticking over the end of his light truck and proceeded with the paneling , which he then stained and waxed according to his taste . </s>
<s> `` now '' , he said , `` we got to put in some outlets for them power tools ; ; </s>
<s> then a couple of fluorescent lamps over the workbench an' i guess we're about through down here '' . </s>
<s> it all did look very efficient and shipshape . </s>
<s> there was no question of that . </s>
<s> `` by the way '' , said mr. blatz , packing his tools into a battered carrier , `` them power tools needs extra voltage . </s>
<s> i guess you know about that . </s>
<s> before you use 'em the light company's got to run in a heavy line and you'll need a new fuse box for the extra circuits . </s>
<s> that ain't too bad 'ceptin' the light company's so busy you can't ever get 'em to do nothin' '' . </s>
<s> instead of being depressed by this news , mr. crombie was actually relieved . </s>
<s> at least the moment was postponed when he had to face the mystery of the power tools . </s>
<s> he followed mr. blatz up the cellar stairs . </s>
<s> as usual , mrs. crombie was standing in the midst of a confusion of cooking utensils . </s>
<s> mr. blatz sat down in the only unoccupied kitchen chair . </s>
<s> `` well '' , he said , `` got your man fixed up nice down there . </s>
<s> he oughta be able to build a new house with all them contraptions '' . </s>
<s> mr. crombie watched his wife with an anxious expression . </s>
<s> `` i was just sayin' to him that i'm all ready now for anything else you want done '' . </s>
<s> mr. crombie couldn't remember his saying any such thing . </s>
<s> `` oh , that's wonderful '' , cried mrs. crombie . </s>
<s> `` i have a thousand things for you to do . </s>
<s> doors that won't open , and doors that won't close and shelves and broken -- '' </s>
<s> `` but those are the things i built the workshop for '' , protested mr. crombie . </s>
<s> `` those are the things i can do , now that i'm set up '' . </s>
<s> `` i've been waiting to get these things done for months '' , she said . </s>
<s> `` we won't live long enough if i wait for you , besides which you don't need to worry -- there'll be plenty more '' . </s>
<s> but the discussion was academic . </s>
<s> mr. blatz was already taking measurements for a shelf above the kitchen sink . </s>
<s> ambiguity </s>
<s> nothing in english has been ridiculed as much as the ambiguous use of words , unless it be the ambiguous use of sentences . </s>
<s> ben franklin said , `` clearly spoken , mr. fogg . </s>
<s> you explain english by greek '' . </s>
<s> richard brinsley sheridan said , `` i think the interpreter is the hardest to be understood of the two '' . </s>
<s> and a witty american journalist remarked over a century ago what is even more true today , `` many a writer seems to think he is never profound except when he can't understand his own meaning '' . </s>
<s> there are many types of ambiguity and many of them have been described by rhetoricians under such names as amphibology , parisology , and other ologies . </s>
<s> in common parlance they would be described as misses -- misinterpreters , misunderstanders , misdirectors and kindred misdeeds . </s>
<s> one species of ambiguity tries to baffle by interweaving repetition . </s>
<s> `` did you or did you not say what i said you said , because jane said you never said what i said '' ? ? </s>
<s> another woman , addressing christmas cards , said to her husband : `` we sent them one last year but they didn't send us one , so they probably won't send us one this year because they'll think we won't send them one because they didn't last year , don't you think , or shall we '' ? ? </s>
<s> such ambiguous exercises compound confusion by making it worse compounded , and they are sometimes expanded until the cream of the jest sours . </s>
<s> ambiguity of a non-repetitious kind describes the dilemma one girl found herself in . </s>
<s> `` i'm terribly upset '' , she told a girl-friend . </s>
<s> `` i wrote bill in my last letter to forget that i had told him that i didn't mean to reconsider my decision not to change my mind -- and he seems to have misunderstood me '' . </s>
<s> evidently bill was another of those men who simply don't understand women . </s>
<s> another case involves a newspaper reporter who tripped up a politician . </s>
<s> `` mr. jones , you may recall that we printed last week your denial of having retracted the contradiction of your original statement . </s>
<s> now would you care to have us say that you were misquoted in regard to it '' ? ? </s>
<s> questions like this , framed in verbal fog , are perhaps the only kind that have ever stumped an experienced politician . </s>
<s> they recall byron's classic comment : `` i wish he would explain his explanation '' . </s>
<s> similarly , when a reporter once questioned lincoln in cryptic fashion , lincoln refused to make any further statement . </s>
<s> `` i fear explanations explanatory of things explained '' , he said , leaving the biter bit -- and bitter . </s>
<s> the obscurity of politicians may not always be as innocent as it looks . </s>
<s> `` senator '' , said an interviewer , `` your constituents can't understand from your speech last night just how you stand on the question '' . </s>
<s> `` good '' ! ! </s>
<s> replied the senator . </s>
<s> `` it took me five hours to write it that way '' . </s>
<s> the misplaced modifier is another species more honored in the observance of obscurity than in the breach . </s>
<s> this creates an amusing effect because its position in a sentence seems to make it apply to the wrong word . </s>
<s> a verse familiar to all grammarians is the quatrain : `` i saw a man once beat his wife when on a drunken spree . </s>
<s> now can you tell me who was drunk -- the man , his wife , or me '' ? ? </s>
<s> the `` wooden-leg '' gag of vaudeville , another standby of this sort , had endless variations . </s>
<s> `` there's a man outside with a wooden leg named smith '' . </s>
<s> `` what's the name of his other leg '' ? ? </s>
<s> another stock vaudeville gag ran : `` mother is home sick in bed with the doctor '' . </s>
<s> when radio came in , it continued the misplaced modifier in its routines as a standard device . </s>
<s> `` do you see that pretty girl standing next to the car with slacks on '' ? ? </s>
<s> `` i see the girl but i don't see the car with slacks on '' . </s>
<s> in recent years gagwriters have discovered this brand of blunder and thus the misplaced modifier has acquired a new habitat in the gagline . </s>
<s> in one cartoon a family is shown outside a theater with the head of the family addressing the doorman : `` excuse me , but when we came out we found that we had left my daughter's handbag and my wife's behind '' . </s>
<s> journalism supplies us with an endless run of such slips . </s>
<s> not long ago a newspaper advised those taking part in a contest that `` snapshots must be of a person not larger than af inches '' . </s>
<s> classified ads are also chockfull of misrelated constructions . </s>
<s> readers of the reader's digest are familiar with such items which often appear in its lists of verbal slips , like the ad in a california paper that advertised `` house for rent . </s>
<s> view takes in five counties , two bedrooms '' . </s>
<s> since brevity is the soul of ambiguity as well as wit , newspaper headlines continually provide us with amusing samples . </s>
<s> `` officials meet on rubbish . </s>
<s> many shapes in bathtubs . </s>
<s> son and daughter of local couple married '' . </s>
<s> apart from misplaced modifiers and headlinese , journalism contributes a wide variety of comic ambiguities in both editorial and advertising matter . </s>
<s> a weekly newspaper reported a local romance : `` and the couple were married last saturday , thus ending a friendship which began in their schooldays '' . </s>
<s> an item in the letters column of a newspaper renewed a subscription , adding : `` i personally enjoy your newspaper as much as my husband '' . </s>
<s> then there was the caterer's ad which read : `` are you getting married or having an affair ? ? </s>
<s> we have complete facilities to accommodate 200 people '' . </s>
<s> the newspaper too is the favorite habitat of the anatomical . </s>
<s> this slip is so-called because its semi-ambiguous english always seems to refer to a person's anatomy but never quite means what it seems to say . </s>
<s> samples : he walked in upon her invitation . </s>
<s> she kissed him passionately upon his reappearance . </s>
<s> he kissed her back . </s>
<s> not without good reason has the anatomical been called jocular journalese . </s>
<s> in news items a man is less often shot in the body or head than in the suburbs . </s>
<s> `` while henry morgan was escorting miss vera green from the church social last saturday night , a savage dog attacked them and bit mr. morgan on the public square '' . </s>
<s> such items recall the california journalist who reported an accident involving a movie star : `` the area in which miss n -- was injured is spectacularly scenic '' . </s>
<s> the double meaning in the anatomical made it a familiar vaudeville device , as in the gags of weber and fields . </s>
<s> when a witness at court was asked if he had been kicked in the ensuing rumpus , he replied , `` no , it was in the stomach '' . </s>
<s> strangely enough , this always brought the house down . </s>
<s> apart from journalese and vaudeville gags , the anatomical is also found in jocular literature . </s>
<s> a conscientious girl became the secretary of a doctor . </s>
<s> her first day at work she was puzzled by an entry in the doctor's notes on an emergency case . </s>
<s> it read : `` shot in the lumbar region '' . </s>
<s> after a moment of thought , her mind cleared and , in the interest of clarity , she typed into the record : `` shot in the woods '' . </s>
<s> there are many grammatical misconstructions other than dangling modifiers and anatomicals which permit two different interpretations . </s>
<s> at the home of a gourmet the new maid was instructed in the fine points of serving . </s>
<s> `` i want the fish served whole , with head and tail '' , the epicure explained , `` and serve it with lemon in mouth '' . </s>
<s> the maid demurred . </s>
<s> `` that's silly -- lemon in mouth '' , she said . </s>

<s> the comic indefinite comprises an extensive class of comedy . </s>
<s> one species is restricted to statements which are neither explicit nor precise regarding a particular person , place , time or thing . </s>
<s> a woman met a famous author at a literary tea . </s>
<s> `` oh , i'm so delighted to meet you '' , she gushed . </s>
<s> `` it was only the other day that i saw something of yours , about something or other , in some magazine '' . </s>

<s> her woolly-minded parent agreed . </s>
<s> `` of course , dear '' , she said . </s>

<s> no less ambiguous was the indefinity of a certain clergyman's sermon . </s>
<s> `` dearly beloved '' , he preached , `` unless you repent of your sins in a measure , and become converted to a degree , you will , i regret to say , be damned to a more or less extent '' . </s>
<s> this clergyman should have referred to shakespeare's dictum : `` so-so is a good , very good , very excellent maxim . </s>

<s> it is but so-so '' . </s>
<s> indefinite reference also carries double-meaning where an allusion to one person or thing seems to refer to another . </s>
<s> a news item described the launching of a ship : `` completing the ceremony , the beautiful movie star smashed a bottle of champagne over her stern as she slid gracefully down the ways into the sea '' . </s>

<s> `` i am '' , he said . </s>
<s> there was a short pause for reflection . </s>
<s> `` oh '' , said the woman , `` i've seen that picture already '' . </s>
<s> another brand of indefinite reference arises out of the use of the double verb . </s>
<s> when a question contains two verbs , the response does not make clear which of them is being answered . </s>
<s> the moonlit night was made for romance , and he had been looking at her soulfully for some time . </s>

<s> he thought a moment , then inquired , `` you mean petted '' ? ? </s>
<s> `` no '' , she smiled , `` objected '' . </s>
<s> replies to requests for character reference are notorious for their evasive double-entendre . </s>
<s> it would be hard to find anything more equivocal than : `` i cannot recommend him too highly '' . </s>
<s> another less ambiguous case read as follows : `` the bearer of this letter has served me for two years to his complete satisfaction . </s>
<s> if you are thinking of giving him a berth , be sure to make it a wide one '' . </s>
<s> in the comedy of indefinite reference , it-wit occupies a prominent place because of its frequent occurrence . </s>
<s> ambiguity arises when the pronoun it carries a twofold reference . </s>
<s> two friends were talking . </s>
<s> one said , `` when i get a cold i buy a bottle of whiskey for it , and within a few hours it's gone '' . </s>
<s> the speaker referred to the whiskey but his friend thought he meant the cold . </s>

<s> my unscientific friend does not believe that human stature is measurable in terms of speed , momentum , weightlessness , or distance from earth , but is a matter of the development of the human mind . </s>
<s> after gagarin became the greatest man in the world , for a nation that does not believe in the cult of personality or in careerism , moreland wrote me a letter in which he said : `` i am not interested in how long a bee can live in a vacuum , or how far it can fly . </s>

<s> one day , the children had wanted to get up onto general burnside's horse . </s>

<s> he looked so comfortable being straight . </s>
<s> they wanted to touch the mystery . </s>
<s> arlene was boosting them up when the policeman came by . </s>
<s> he was very rude . </s>
<s> arlene had a hard voice , too , this time . </s>
<s> the policeman's eyes rather popped for a second ; ; </s>

<s> the policeman got a confused , funny look on his face , and he had answered kind of politely , `` now , look here , lady : i know you got to entertain these kids and all . </s>
<s> but this is a public park and it's a city ordinance that the statues cannot be crawled on '' . </s>
<s> arlene was so ashamed that she hung her head when she said , `` yes , sir '' . </s>
<s> the policeman walked on , but he looked back once . </s>
<s> that had happened on the day when two other unusual things had occurred . </s>
<s> arlene had taught them a new way to have fun in their little private area ; ; </s>
<s> and they had told their mother about the tumbles . </s>
<s> in matters of exact information , that kept her one step behind developments ; ; </s>
<s> and so they were consistently true to their principles . </s>
<s> `` never mind '' , arlene had said , after the policeman had left , having pursued the usual unco-operative course of grownups . </s>
<s> `` never mind . </s>
<s> i know something that is much more fun that we can do on our little lawn '' . </s>
<s> `` what is it '' ? ? </s>
<s> asked the children , whose reflexes and replies were invariably so admirably normal and predictable . </s>
<s> maybe that was why they were cordial and loyal towards the unpredictability of arlene . </s>
<s> `` just you wait '' , advised arlene , echoing the dialogue in a recent british movie . </s>
<s> and when they had got to their little lawn , they had had a most twirlingly magnificent time . </s>
<s> first , arlene had put them through some rapid somersaults . </s>
<s> they had protested that that wasn't any surprise . </s>
<s> `` just you wait '' , said arlene again , as though she were discovering the pleasantly tingling insinuations of that handy little sturdy statement . </s>
<s> `` this is a warm-up '' . </s>
<s> `` is it anything like cooked-over oatmeal '' ? ? </s>
<s> asked one of the children . </s>
<s> `` not the least bit '' , arlene snapped . </s>
<s> one of the many things that was so nice about her was that she always took your questions seriously , particularly your very , very serious questions . </s>
<s> those were especially the ones that all other grownups laughed at loudest . </s>
<s> she would sometimes even get a little hard on you , she took you so seriously . </s>
<s> but not hard for very long . </s>
<s> just long enough to make you feel important . </s>
<s> `` now '' , said arlene , eventually , making them both sit in formation on a big root of a live oak , the sort of root that divided itself and made their bottoms sag down and feel comfortable . </s>
<s> `` now , we're going to be like what general burnside and his horse make us think of '' . </s>
<s> the children looked at each other and sagged their bottoms down even more comfortably than ever . </s>
<s> their curiosity went happily out of bounds . </s>
<s> then , arlene threw herself backwards and wiggled in a way that was just wonderful . </s>
<s> she held herself that way and turned her head towards them and laughed and winked . </s>
<s> `` imagine being able to laugh and wink when you're like the top part of that picture frame at home '' , one of them said . </s>
<s> they both laughed and winked back . </s>
<s> `` i'm general burnside's horse , upside down '' , arlene said , sort of gaspingly , for her : even she had to breathe kind of funny when she was in that position . </s>
<s> she made general burnside's horse's belly do so funny when it was upside down . </s>
<s> then , she was back on her feet , winking and smiling that enormous smile ( she had lots of wonderful big teeth that you never would have suspected she had when she was not smiling ) . </s>
<s> and she would wink and throw kisses . </s>
<s> they both tried to keep smiling and winking for a long time , but it made their lips and eyelids tremble . </s>
<s> but they kept on clapping for a long , long time . </s>
<s> `` this time '' , arlene said , and she even kept on wiggling a little bit while she was just talking , `` you're going to tell me what i am and what i'm doing . </s>
<s> it all has something to do with general burnside and his horse '' . </s>
<s> this time , it was so grand ; ; </s>
<s> they could tell exactly what it was . </s>
<s> it was general burnside's horse running in a circle . </s>
<s> his legs shook , and the shaking went right on up his body through his hips to his shoulders . </s>
<s> `` that's the general's horse '' , one of them cried out . </s>
<s> the other remarked , in a happy laughter , `` that's a funny old horse '' . </s>
<s> the first one said , `` he sure does shake . </s>
<s> he's old '' . </s>
<s> then there was the general kissing his wife . </s>
<s> they had to be told that one . </s>
<s> but it was even funnier after they had been told . </s>
<s> their father , when he came back from those many business trips , just bumped their mother on the forehead with his lips and asked if anybody had thought to mix the martinis and put them in the electric icebox . </s>
<s> but not general burnside . </s>
<s> he was the funniest man . </s>
<s> he never could keep still , even when he didn't move his feet . </s>
<s> then , they had to get up and be general burnside . </s>
<s> or his horse . </s>
<s> all they could think of was to run around in circles , kicking their legs out . </s>
<s> it wasn't very funny . </s>
<s> then , they said general burnside was going to jump over his horse's head ; ; </s>
<s> and they did some somersaults . </s>
<s> but that wasn't very funny , either . </s>
<s> `` you ought to shake '' , arlene advised them . </s>
<s> and arlene showed them how to begin . </s>
<s> she also taught them to sing `` i wish i could shimmy like my sister kate '' . </s>
<s> that helped a lot . </s>
<s> they were clumsy , but they were beginning to catch on . </s>
<s> they also caught on a little bit on how to smile a lot without your lips trembling . </s>
<s> `` imagine you won't get your allowance if you're caught not smiling -- or smiling with your lips trembling too much '' , arlene suggested . </s>
<s> that helped a great deal . </s>
<s> they were a little late in getting home . </s>
<s> `` i'm sorry , mrs. minks '' , arlene said in a tone so low you could hardly hear it . </s>
<s> my mother constituted herself the voice of all of us . </s>
<s> `` it's perfectly understandable , arlene '' , my mother said in a friendly way . </s>
<s> `` i suppose you all were playing and forgot '' ? ? </s>
<s> `` yes , ma'am '' , the children chorused heartily . </s>
<s> we couldn't help laughing . </s>
<s> the children rushed off to get rid of their sweaters ; ; </s>
<s> and arlene began tapping the kitchen door open . </s>
<s> `` arlene's a good girl '' , my uncle remarked to us ; ; </s>
<s> but he said it too soon , for it came out just before the tap to which the door responded . </s>
<s> that tap had a slight bangish quality . </s>
<s> `` she really is a dear little thing '' , my mother agreed . </s>
<s> her upper lip lifted slightly . </s>
<s> she was biting into a small red radish ; ; </s>
<s> and that action always caused her to lift her lip from the sting of the thing . </s>
<s> also , she lived in continual fear of finding a white worm curled up in a neat , mean little heap at the white center of the radish . </s>
<s> she would try to see over the bulge of her cheeks and somewhat under her teeth to the place where she was biting . </s>
<s> it never worked , naturally ; ; </s>
<s> but it made her look unusual . </s>
<s> also , when she had bitten off half of the small radish , she found the suspense unbearable ; ; </s>
<s> and she would snatch the finger-held half of the radish out to where she could inspect it . </s>
<s> one could hear a very faint , ladylike sigh of relief . </s>
<s> actually , it was inaudible to anyone not expecting it . </s>
<s> but the warm joy of her brown eyes was open to the general public . </s>
<s> later on , the children told her further about somersaulting . </s>
<s> `` it must be awfully good for them . </s>
<s> and awfully kind of arlene '' , she told us later . </s>
<s> `` but do you know something curious '' ? ? </s>
<s> she added . </s>
<s> `` i reached into that funny little pocket that is high up on my dress . </s>
<s> i have no notion why i reached . </s>
<s> and i found a radish . </s>
<s> was it an omen ? ? </s>
<s> i thought for a second . </s>
<s> but i would not pamper myself in that silly way . </s>
<s> i opened the window and threw the radish out '' . </s>
<s> then , my mother blushed at this small lie ; ; </s>
<s> for she knew and we knew that it was cowardice that had made one more radish that night just too impossible a strain . </s>
<s> arlene became indispensable ; ; </s>
<s> nobody could have told why . </s>
<s> but she was . </s>
<s> it was in the air . </s>
<s> a friend of my father's came to dinner . </s>
<s> he was passing through town and phoned to say hello . </s>
<s> as a result , he was persuaded out to dinner . </s>
<s> as a matter of fact , this happened every four or five months . </s>
<s> sometimes , he coincided with my father's being at home . </s>
<s> sometimes , as at this juncture , he did not . </s>
<s> but he was always persuaded out . </s>
<s> he liked children , in a loathsome kind of way ; ; </s>
<s> the two youngest in our family always had to be brought in and put through tricks for his entertainment . </s>
<s> when he had left , i could never remember whether he had poked them in their middles , laughingly , with a thick index finger or whether he was merely so much the sort of person who did this that one assumed the action , not bothering to look . </s>
<s> the children loathed him , too . </s>
<s> this evening , they were pushed in from the breakfast room , with odds and ends of dessert distributed over them . </s>
<s> there had been some coconut in it , for i remember my mother's taking a quick glance at a stringy bit of this nut on the cheek of one of them and then putting down her radish with a shiver . </s>
<s> they were pushed gently into the room by arlene -- whose only part appearing were hands that crept quickly back around to the kitchen side of the door . </s>
<s> we had just sat down . </s>
<s> `` tell mr. gorboduc what you're doing these days '' , my mother advised the children , ceremonially . </s>
<s> there was an air of revolt about the children -- even irreverence for their own principles . </s>
<s> this could be told chiefly from a sort of head-tossing and prancing , a horselike balkiness of demeanor . </s>
<s> possibly , the coconut-containing dessert had brought up bitter problems of administration . </s>
<s> but , at the beginning , this stayed just in the air . </s>
<s> `` we go to the park with this nice lady '' , one of them said . </s>
<s> `` we have good times '' . </s>
<s> this happy bulletin convulsed mr. gorboduc . </s>
<s> `` you do '' ? ? </s>
<s> he asked , between wheezes of laughter . </s>
<s> he was forced to wipe his eyes . </s>
<s> `` you don't step on the flowers , do you ? ? </s>
<s> eh '' ? ? </s>
<s> one of the children maneuvered out of range of the poking index finger . </s>
<s> `` no '' , he said . </s>
<s> `` we don't '' . </s>
<s> mr. gorboduc took a swig of his sherry . </s>
<s> he was so long thinking that my mother had time to inspect her sherry for dregs . </s>
<s> usually , this was done when attention was diverted by someone else's long , boring story . </s>
<s> but this time she was nervous : she was open . </s>
<s> mr. gorboduc was finally in command of his mind again . </s>
<s> `` tell me -- what do you do at the park '' ? ? </s>
<s> he asked . </s>
<s> this was delivered in a forthright way , without coyness and over-pretended interest -- an admirable way with children . </s>
<s> only , unfortunately , he could not remove from his voice a nagging insinuation of the direct command . </s>
<s> this nettled the children into the revelation of exact truth , a sacrifice of their secret superiority over grown people , but a victory in the wide fields of perpetration and illegitimate accomplishment . </s>
<s> `` we bump '' , one said ; ; </s>
<s> and the other went on to development of the idea . </s>

<s> for example , probably very few people know that the word `` visrhanik '' that is bantered about so much today stems from the verb `` bouanahsha '' : to salivate . </s>
<s> likewise , and equally fascinating , is the news that such unlikely synonyms as `` pratakku '' , `` sweathruna '' , and the tongue-twister `` nnuolapertar-it-vuh-karti-birifw- '' all originated in the same village in bathar-on-walli province and are all used to express sentiments concerning british `` imperialism '' . </s>
<s> the terms are fairly safe to use on this side of the ocean , but before you start spouting them to your date , it might be best to find out if he was a member of major pockmanster's delhi regiment , since resentment toward the natives was reportedly very high in that outfit . </s>
<s> the breeze and chancellor neitzbohr , a movie melodrama that concerns the attempts of a west german politician to woo a plaster cast of the apollo belvedere . </s>
<s> as you have doubtless guessed already , the plot is plastered with freudian , jungian , and meinckian theory . </s>
<s> for example , when the film is only four minutes old , neitzbohr refers to a small , victorian piano stool as `` wilhelmina '' , and we are thereupon subjected to a flashback that informs us that this very piano stool was once used by an epileptic governess whose name , of course , was doris ( the english equivalent , when passed through middle-gaelic derivations , of wilhelmina ) . </s>
<s> for the remainder of the movie , chancellor neitzbohr proceeds to lash the piano stool with a slat from a venetian blind that used to hang in the pre-war reichstag . </s>
<s> in this manner , he seeks to expunge from his own soul the guilt pangs caused by his personal assaults against the english at dunkirk . </s>
<s> as we find out at the end , it is not the stool ( symbolizing doris , therefore the english ) that he is punishing but the piece of venetian blind . </s>
<s> and , when the slat finally shatters , we see him count the fragments , all the while muttering , `` he loves me , he loves me not '' . </s>
<s> after a few tortuous moments of wondering who `` he '' is , the camera pans across the room to the plaster statue , and we realize that neitzbohr is trying to redeem himself in the eyes of a mute piece of sculpture . </s>

<s> the music of bini salfininistas , capital lp ab63711-r , one of the rare recordings of this titanic , yet unsung , composer . </s>
<s> those persons who were lucky enough to see and hear the performance of his work at the brest-silevniov festival in august , 1916 , will certainly welcome his return to public notice ; ; </s>
<s> and it is not unlikely that , even as the great bach lay dormant for so many years , so has the erudite , ingenious salfininistas passed through his `` purgatory '' of neglect . </s>
<s> but now , under the guidance of the contemporary composer marc schlek , jr. , a major revival is under way . </s>
<s> as he leads the neurenschatz skolkau orchestra , schlek gives a tremendously inspired performance of both the baslot and rattzhenfuut concertos , including the controversial tschilwyk cadenza , which was included at the conductor's insistence . </s>
<s> a major portion of the credit should also go to flautist haumd for his rendering of the almost impossible `` indianapolis '' movement in the baslot . </s>
<s> not only was haumd's intonation and phrasing without flaw , but he seemed to take every tonal eccentricity in stride . </s>
<s> for example , to move ( as the score requires ) from the lowest f-major register up to a barely audible n minor in four seconds , not skipping , at the same time , even one of the 407 fingerings , seems a feat too absurd to consider , and it is to the flautist's credit that he remained silent throughout the passage . </s>
<s> we would have preferred , however , to have had the rest of the orchestra refrain from laughing at this and other spots on the recording , since it mars an otherwise sober , if not lofty , performance . </s>
<s> as broadway itself becomes increasingly weighted down by trite , heavy-handed , commercially successful musicals and inspirational problem dramas , the american theatre is going through an inexorable renaissance in that nebulous area known as `` off-broadway '' . </s>
<s> for the last two years , this frontier of the arts has produced a number of so-called `` non-dramas '' which have left indelible , bittersweet impressions on the psyche of this veteran theatregoer . </s>
<s> the latest and , significantly , greatest fruit of this theatrical vine is the , an adaptation of basho's classic frog-haiku by roger entwhistle , a former university of maryland chemistry instructor . </s>
<s> although the play does show a certain structural amateurishness ( there are eleven acts varying in length from twenty-five seconds to an hour and a half ) , the statement it makes concerning the ceaseless yearning and searching of youth is profound and worthy of our attention . </s>
<s> the action centers about a group of outspoken and offbeat students sitting around a table in a cafeteria and their collective and ultimately fruitless search for a cup of hot coffee . </s>
<s> they are relentlessly rebuffed on all sides by a waitress , the police , and an intruding government tutor . </s>
<s> the innocence that they tried to conceal at the beginning is clearly destroyed forever when one of them , asking for a piece of lemon-meringue pie , gets a plate of english muffins instead . </s>
<s> leaving the theatre after the performance , i had a flash of intuition that life , after all ( as rilke said ) , is just a search for the nonexistent cup of hot coffee , and that this unpretentious , moving , clever , bitter slice of life was the greatest thing to happen to the american theatre since brooks atkinson retired . </s>
<s> aging but still precocious , french feline enfant terrible francoisette lagoon has succeeded in shocking jaded old paris again , this time with a sexy ballet scenario called the lascivious interlude , the story of a nymphomaniac trip-hammer operator who falls hopelessly in love with a middle-aged steam shovel . </s>
<s> a biting , pithy parable of the all-pervading hollowness of modern life , the piece has been set by mlle lagoon to a sumptuous score ( a single motif played over and over by four thousand french horns ) by existentialist hot-shot jean-paul sartre . </s>

<s> ever since bambi , and , more recently , born free , there have been a lot of books about animals , but few compare with max fink's wry , understated , charming , and immensely readable my friend , the quizzical salamander . </s>
<s> done in the modern style of a `` confession '' , fink tells in exquisite detail how he came to know , and , more important , love his mother's pet salamander , alicia . </s>
<s> it is not an entirely happy book , as mrs. fink soon becomes jealous of alicia and , in retaliation , refuses to continue to scrape the algae off her glass . </s>
<s> max , in a fit of despair , takes alicia and runs off for two marvelous weeks in burbank ( fink calls it `` the most wonderful and lovely fourteen days in my whole life '' ) , at the end of which alicia tragically contracts parkinson's disease and dies . </s>

<s> opera in the grand tradition , along with mah-jongg , seems to be staging a well-deserved comeback . </s>
<s> in this country , the two guiding lights are , without doubt , felix fing and anna pulova . </s>
<s> fing , a lean , chiseled , impeccable gentleman of the old school who was once mistaken on the street for sir cedric hardwicke , is responsible for the rediscovery of verdi's earliest , most raucous opera , nabisco , a sumptuous bout-de-souffle with a haunting leitmotiv that struck me as being highly reminiscent of the mudugno version of `` volare '' . </s>
<s> miss pulova has a voice that maria callas once described as `` like chipping teeth with a screw driver '' , and her round , opalescent face becomes fascinatingly reflective of the emotions demanded by the role of rosalie . </s>

<s> the battle of the drib-drool continues , but most of new york's knowing sophisticates of abstract expressionism are stamping their feet impatiently in expectation of v ( for vindication ) day , september first , when augustus quasimodo's first one-man show opens at the guggenheim . </s>
<s> we have heard that after seeing mr. quasimodo's work it will be virtually impossible to deny the artistic validity and importance of the whole abstract movement . </s>
<s> and it is thought by many who think about such things that quasimodo is the logical culmination of a school that started with monet , progressed through kandinsky and the cubist picasso , and blossomed just recently in pollock and de kooning . </s>
<s> quasimodo defines his own art as `` the search for what is not there '' . </s>
<s> `` i paint the nothing '' , he said once to franz kline and myself , `` the nothing that is behind the something , the inexpressible , unpaintable ' tick ' in the unconscious , the ' spirit ' of the moment resting forever , suspended like a huge balloon , in non-time '' . </s>
<s> it is his relentlessness and unwaivering adherence to this revolutionary artistic philosophy that has enabled him to paint such pictures as `` the invasion of cuba '' . </s>
<s> in this work , his use of non-color is startling and skillful . </s>
<s> the sweep of space , the delicate counterbalance of the white masses , the over-all completeness and unity , the originality and imagination , all entitle it to be called an authentic masterpiece . </s>
<s> i asked quasimodo recently how he accomplished this , and he replied that he had painted his model `` a beautiful shade of red and then had her breathe on the canvas '' , which was his typical tongue-in-cheek way of chiding me for my lack of sensitivity . </s>
<s> dear sirs : let me begin by clearing up any possible misconception in your minds , wherever you are . </s>
<s> the collective by which i address you in the title above is neither patronizing nor jocose but an exact industrial term in use among professional thieves . </s>

<s> i.e. , burglars who rob while the tenants are absent , in contrast to hot-slough prowlers , those who work while the occupants are home . </s>
<s> since the latter obviously require an audacity you do not possess , you may perhaps suppose that i am taunting you as socially inferior . </s>
<s> far from it ; ; </s>
<s> i merely draw an etymological distinction , hoping that specialists and busy people like you will welcome such precision in a layman . </s>
<s> above all , disabuse yourselves of any thought that i propose to vent moral indignation at your rifling my residence , to whimper over the loss of a few objets d'art , or to shame you into rectitude . </s>
<s> my object , rather , is to alert you to an aspect or two of the affair that could have the gravest implications for you , far beyond the legal sanctions society might inflict . </s>
<s> you have unwittingly set in motion forces so malign , so vindictive , that it would be downright inhumane of me not to warn you about them . </s>
<s> quite candidly , fellows , i wouldn't be in your shoes for all the rice in china . </s>
<s> as you've doubtless forgotten the circumstances in the press of more recent depredations , permit me to recapitulate them briefly . </s>
<s> sometime on saturday evening , august 22nd , while my family and i were dining at the hostaria dell' orso , in rome , you jimmied a window of our home in bucks county , pennsylvania , and let yourselves into the premises . </s>
<s> hastening to the attic , the temperature of which was easily hotter than the gold coast , you proceeded to mask the windows with a fancy wool coverlet , some khaki pants , and the like , and to ransack the innumerable boxes and barrels stored there . </s>
<s> what you were looking for ( unless you make a hobby of collecting old tennis rackets and fly screens ) eludes me , but to judge from phonograph records scattered about a fumed-oak victrola . </s>
<s> you danced two tangos and a paso doble , which must have been fairly enervating in that milieu . </s>
<s> you then descended one story , glommed a television set from the music room -- the only constructive feature of your visit , by the way -- and , returning to the ground floor , entered the master bedroom . </s>
<s> from the curio cabinet on its south wall and the bureaus beneath , you abstracted seventeen ivory , metal , wood , and stone sculptures of oriental and african origin , two snuffboxes , and a jade-handled magnifying glass . </s>
<s> rummaging through a stack of drawers nearby , you unearthed an antique french chess set in ivory and sandalwood , which , along with two box kodaks , you added to your haul . </s>
<s> then , having wrapped the lot in an afghan my dog customarily slept on , you lammed out the front door , considerately leaving it open for neighbors to discover . </s>
<s> so much for the tiresome facts , as familiar to you , i'm sure , as to the constables and state troopers who followed in your wake . </s>
<s> the foregoing , aided by several clues i'll withhold to keep you on your toes , will pursue you with a tenacity worthy of inspector javert , but before they close in , gird yourselves , i repeat , for a vengeance infinitely more pitiless . </s>
<s> fourteen of the sculptures you took possess properties of a most curious and terrifying nature , as you will observe when your limbs begin to wither and your hair falls out in patches . </s>
<s> in time , these minor manifestations will multiply and effloresce , riddling you with frambesia , the king's evil , sheep rot , and clonic spasm , until your very existence becomes a burden and you cry out for release . </s>
<s> all this , though , is simply a prelude , a curtain-raiser , for what ensues , and i doubt whether any occidental could accurately forecast it . </s>
<s> if , however , it would help to intensify your anguish , i can delimit the powers of a few of the divinities you've affronted and describe the punishment they meted out in one analogous instance . </s>
<s> hold on tight . </s>
<s> first of all , the six figures of the buddha you heisted -- four siamese heads , a black obsidian statuette in the earth-touching position , and a large brass figure of the dying buddha on a teakwood base . </s>
<s> now , you probably share the widespread western belief that the lord buddha is the most compassionate of the gods , much more so than jehovah and allah and the rest . </s>
<s> 'fess up -- don't you ? ? </s>
<s> well , ordinarily he is , except ( as the wheel of the law specifies ) toward impious folk who steal , disturb , or maltreat the presence . </s>
<s> very peculiar retribution indeed seems to overtake such jokers . </s>
<s> eight or ten years ago , a couple of french hoods stole a priceless khmer head from the musee guimet , in paris , and a week later crawled into the salpetriere with unmistakable symptoms of leprosy . </s>
<s> hell's own amount of chaulmoogra oil did nothing to alleviate their torment ; ; </s>
<s> they expired amid indescribable fantods , imploring the blessed one to forgive their desecration . </s>
<s> any reputable french interne can supply you with a dozen similar instances , and i'll presently recount a case out of my own personal experience , but , for the moment , let's resume our catalogue . </s>
<s> whether the pair of sudanese ivory carvings you lifted really possess the juju to turn your livers to lead , as a dealer in khartoum assured me , i am not competent to say . </s>
<s> likewise the ivory chinese female figure known as a `` doctor lady '' ( provenance honan ) ; ; </s>
<s> a friend of mine removing her from the curio cabinet for inspection was felled as if by a hammer , but he had previously drunk a quantity of applejack . </s>
<s> the three indian brass deities , though -- ganessa , siva , and krishna -- are an altogether different cup of tea . </s>
<s> they hail from travancore , a state in the subcontinent where kali , the goddess of death , is worshiped . </s>
<s> have you ever heard of thuggee ? ? </s>
<s> nuf sed . </s>
<s> but it is the wooden sculpture from bali , the one representing two men with their heads bent backward and their bodies interlaced by a fish , that i particularly call to your attention . </s>
<s> oddly enough , this is an amulet against housebreakers , presented to the mem and me by a local rajah in 1949 . </s>
<s> inscribed around its base is a charm in balinese , a dialect i take it you don't comprehend . </s>
<s> neither do i , but the tjokorda agoeng was good enough to translate , and i'll do as much for you . </s>
<s> whosoever violates our rooftree , the legend states , can expect maximal sorrow . </s>
<s> the teeth will rain from his mouth like pebbles , his wife will make him cocu with fishmongers , and a trolley car will grow in his stomach . </s>
<s> furthermore -- and this , to me , strikes an especially warming note -- it shall avail the vandals naught to throw away or dispose of their loot . </s>
<s> the cycle of disaster starts the moment they touch any belonging of ours , and dogs them unto the forty-fifth generation . </s>
<s> sort of remorseless , isn't it ? ? </s>
<s> still , there it is . </s>
<s> now , you no doubt regard the preceding as pap ; ; </s>
<s> you're tooling around full of gage in your hot rods , gorging yourselves on pizza and playing pinball in the taverns and generally behaving like ubermenschen . </s>
<s> in that case , listen to what befell another wisenheimer who tangled with our joss . </s>
<s> a couple of years back , i occupied a village apartment whose outer staircase contained the type of niche called a `` coffin turn '' . </s>
<s> in it was a stone tibetan buddha i had picked up in bombay , and occasionally , to make merit , my wife and i garlanded it with flowers or laid a few pennies in its lap . </s>
<s> after a while , we became aware that the money was disappearing as fast as we replenished it . </s>
<s> our suspicions eventually centered , by the process of elimination , on a grocer's boy , a thoroughly bad hat , who delivered cartons to the people overhead . </s>
<s> the more i probed into this young man's activities and character , the less savory i found him . </s>
<s> i learned , for example , that he made a practice of yapping at dogs he encountered and , in winter , of sprinkling salt on the icy pavement to scarify their feet . </s>
<s> his energy was prodigious ; ; </s>
<s> sometimes he would be up before dawn , clad as a garbage collector and hurling pails into areaways to exasperate us , and thereafter would hurry to the bronx zoo to grimace at the lions and press cigar butts against their paws . </s>
<s> evenings , he was frequently to be seen at restaurants like enrico & paglieri's or peter's backyard drunkenly donning ladies' hats and singing `` o sole mio '' . </s>
<s> in short , and to borrow an arboreal phrase , slash timber . </s>
<s> well , the odious little toad went along chivying animals and humans who couldn't retaliate , and in due course , as was inevitable , overreached himself . </s>
<s> one morning , we discovered not only that the pennies were missing from the idol but that a cigarette had been stubbed out in its lap . </s>
<s> `` now he's bought it '' , said my wife contentedly . </s>
<s> `` no divinity will hold still for that . </s>
<s> he's really asking for it '' . </s>
<s> and how right she was . </s>
<s> the next time we saw him , he was a changed person ; ; </s>
<s> he had aged thirty years , and his face , the color of tallow , was crisscrossed with wrinkles , as though it had been wrapped in chicken wire . </s>
<s> some sort of nemesis was haunting his footsteps , he told us in a quavering voice -- either an ape specter or abe spector , a process-server , we couldn't determine which . </s>
<s> his eyes had the same dreadful rigid stare as dr. grimesby roylott's when he was found before his open safe wearing the speckled band . </s>
<s> the grocery the youth worked for soon tired of his depressing effect on customers , most of whom were sufficiently neurotic without the threat of incubi , and let him go . </s>
<s> the beautiful , the satisfying part of his disintegration , however , was the masterly way the buddha polished him off . </s>
<s> reduced to beggary , he at last got a job as office boy to a television producer . </s>
<s> his hubris , deficiency of taste , and sadism carried him straightaway to the top . </s>
<s> he evolved programs that plumbed new depths of bathos and besmirched whole networks , and quickly superseded his boss . </s>
<s> not long ago , i rode down with him in an elevator in radio city ; ; </s>
<s> he was talking to himself thirteen to the dozen and smoking two cigars at once , clearly a man in extremis . </s>
<s> `` see that guy '' ? ? </s>
<s> the operator asked pityingly . </s>
<s> `` i wouldn't be in his shoes for all the rice in china . </s>
<s> there's some kind of a nemesis haunting his footsteps '' . </s>
<s> however one looks at it , therefore , i'd say that your horoscope for this autumn is the reverse of rosy . </s>
<s> the inventory you acquired from me isn't going to be easy to move ; ; </s>
<s> you can't very well sidle up to people on the street and ask if they want to buy a hot bodhisattva . </s>
<s> additionally , since you're going to be hors de combat pretty soon with sprue , yaws , delhi boil , the granville wilt , liver fluke , bilharziasis , and a host of other complications of the hex you've aroused , you mustn't expect to be lionized socially . </s>
<s> my advice , if you live long enough to continue your vocation , is that the next time you're attracted by the exotic , pass it up -- it's nothing but a headache . </s>
